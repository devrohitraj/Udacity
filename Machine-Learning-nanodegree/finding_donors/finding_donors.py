# ## Getting Started
# 
# In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. 
# 
# The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.

# ----
# ## Exploring the Data
# Run the code cell below to load necessary Python libraries and load the census data. Note that the last column from this dataset, `'income'`, will be our target label (whether an individual makes more than, or at most, $50,000 annually). All other columns are features about each individual in the census database.

# In[2]:

# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from time import time
from IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames

# Import supplementary visualization code visuals.py
import visuals as vs

# Pretty display for notebooks
get_ipython().magic(u'matplotlib inline')

# Load the Census dataset
data = pd.read_csv("census.csv")

# Success - Display the first record
display(data.head(n=5))


# ### Implementation: Data Exploration
# A cursory investigation of the dataset will determine how many individuals fit into either group, and will tell us about the percentage of these individuals making more than \$50,000. In the code cell below, you will need to compute the following:
# - The total number of records, `'n_records'`
# - The number of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'n_greater_50k'`.
# - The number of individuals making at most \$50,000 annually, `'n_at_most_50k'`.
# - The percentage of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'greater_percent'`.
# 
# **Hint:** You may need to look at the table above to understand how the `'income'` entries are formatted. 

# In[5]:

# TODO: Total number of records
n_records = len(data)

# TODO: Number of records where individual's income is more than $50,000
n_greater_50k = np.sum(data['income'] == '>50K')

# TODO: Number of records where individual's income is at most $50,000
n_at_most_50k = np.sum(data['income'] == '<=50K')

# TODO: Percentage of individuals whose income is more than $50,000
greater_percent = 100 * n_greater_50k/float(n_records)

# Print the results
print "Total number of records: {}".format(n_records)
print "Individuals making more than $50,000: {}".format(n_greater_50k)
print "Individuals making at most $50,000: {}".format(n_at_most_50k)
print "Percentage of individuals making more than $50,000: {:.2f}%".format(greater_percent)

# ----
# ## Preparing the Data
# Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms.

# ### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features
# A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. 
# 
# Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed.

# In[7]:

# Split the data into features and target label
income_raw = data['income']
features_raw = data.drop('income', axis = 1)

# Visualize skewed continuous features of original data
vs.distribution(data)


# For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.
# 
# Run the code cell below to perform a transformation on the data and visualize the results. Again, note the range of values and how they are distributed. 

# In[8]:

# Log-transform the skewed features
skewed = ['capital-gain', 'capital-loss']
features_raw[skewed] = data[skewed].apply(lambda x: np.log(x + 1))

# Visualize the new log distributions
vs.distribution(features_raw, transformed = True)


# ### Normalizing Numerical Features
# In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.
# 
# Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this.

# In[9]:

# Import sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Initialize a scaler, then apply it to the features
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
numerical = ['age', 'education-num', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'hours-per-week']
features_raw[numerical] = scaler.fit_transform(data[numerical])

# Show an example of a record with scaling applied
display(features_raw.head(n = 5))


# ### Implementation: Data Preprocessing
# 
# From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _"dummy"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.
# 
# |   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |
# | :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |
# | 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
# | 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |
# | 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |
# 
# Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label ("<=50K" and ">50K"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.
#  - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.
#    - Set records with "<=50K" to `0` and records with ">50K" to `1`.

# In[10]:

from pandas import get_dummies

# TODO: One-hot encode the 'features_raw' data using pandas.get_dummies()
features = get_dummies(features_raw)

# TODO: Encode the 'income_raw' data to numerical values
income = income_raw.apply(lambda x: 1 if x == '>50K' else 0)
''' Or can use below code too instead of .apply function '''
# income = get_dummies(income_raw)['>50K']

# Print the number of features after one-hot encoding
encoded = list(features.columns)
print "{} total features after one-hot encoding.".format(len(encoded))

# Uncomment the following line to see the encoded feature names
print encoded


# ### Shuffle and Split Data
# Now all _categorical variables_ have been converted into numerical features, and all numerical features have been normalized. As always, we will now split the data (both features and their labels) into training and test sets. 80% of the data will be used for training and 20% for testing.
# 
# Run the code cell below to perform this split.

# In[12]:

# Import train_test_split
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split

# Split the 'features' and 'income' data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, income, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)

# Show the results of the split
print "Training set has {} samples.".format(X_train.shape[0])
print "Testing set has {} samples.".format(X_test.shape[0])


# ----
# ## Evaluating Model Performance
# In this section, we will investigate four different algorithms, and determine which is best at modeling the data. Three of these algorithms will be supervised learners of your choice, and the fourth algorithm is known as a *naive predictor*.

# ### Metrics and the Naive Predictor
# *CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:
# 
# $$ F_{\beta} = (1 + \beta^2) \cdot \frac{precision \cdot recall}{\left( \beta^2 \cdot precision \right) + recall} $$
# 
# In particular, when $\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).
# 
# Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *"this person does not make more than \$50,000"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. 

# ### Question 1 - Naive Predictor Performace
# *If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than \$50,000, what would that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset?*  
# **Note:** You must use the code cell below and assign your results to `'accuracy'` and `'fscore'` to be used later.

# In[13]:

# TODO: Calculate accuracy

accuracy = greater_percent/ 100.0

# TODO: Calculate F-score using the formula above for beta = 0.5
recall = 1
beta = 0.5

fscore = (1 + beta * beta) * (accuracy*recall)/((beta*beta*accuracy)+recall)

# Print the results 
print "Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: {:.4f}, F-score: {:.4f}]".format(accuracy, fscore)


# ###  Supervised Learning Models
# **The following supervised learning models are currently available in** [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) **that you may choose from:**
# - Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
# - Decision Trees
# - Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
# - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)
# - Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)
# - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
# - Logistic Regression

# ### Question 2 - Model Application
# List three of the supervised learning models above that are appropriate for this problem that you will test on the census data. For each model chosen
# - *Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.* (You may need to do research for this — give references!)
# - *What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?*
# - *What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?*
# - *What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?*

# **Answer: Logistic Regression: 1)HealthCare Applications whether a person is depressed or not based on bag of words from the corpus seems to be conveniently solvable using logistic regression.
# 2) Advantages: It is fast, efficient, low variance and works well in single decision boundary.
# 3) Weakness: it cannot capture complex relationship in data and will not work well in multiple decision boundary.
# 4) what makes Good candidate: It is very simple and widely used in industries.
# 
# SVM: 1) Image Processing and digit Recognition
# 2) Advantages: SVM supports kernels, so you can model even non-linear relations
# 3) Disadvantages: Overfitting, complex parameters like c and kernels
# 4) what makes Good candidate: it's powerful in capturing complex relationships in data automatically with various parameters like c and kernels like amking non-linear relations.
# 
# Gaussian Naive Bayes: 1) Spam filter and email_classification
# 2) Advantages: fast, highly scalable model building and scoring
# 3) Disadvantages: makes a very strong assumption on the shape of your data distribution
# 4) what makes Good candidate: it's simple and general for classification of datasets with complex relationships

# ### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline
# To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).
#  - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.
#  - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.
#    - Record the total prediction time.
#  - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.
#  - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.
#    - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter!

    # Success

    # Return the results
    return results


# ### Implementation: Initial Model Evaluation
# In the code cell, you will need to implement the following:
# - Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.
# - Initialize the three models and store them in `'clf_A'`, `'clf_B'`, and `'clf_C'`.
#   - Use a `'random_state'` for each model you use, if provided.
#   - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.
# - Calculate the number of records equal to 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data.
#   - Store those values in `'samples_1'`, `'samples_10'`, and `'samples_100'` respectively.
# 
# **Note:** Depending on which algorithms you chose, the following implementation may take some time to run!

# In[18]:

# TODO: Import the three supervised learning models from sklearn

clf_C = GaussianNB()

# TODO: Calculate the number of samples for 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data
n_train = len(y_train)
print n_train
samples_1 = int(n_train * 0.01)

samples_100 = n_train

# Collect results on the learners

for clf in [clf_A, clf_B, clf_C]:

        results[clf_name][i] =         train_predict(clf, samples, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)

        
for i in results.items():
    print i[0]
    display(pd.DataFrame(i[1]).rename(columns={0:'1%', 1:'10%', 2:'100%'}))

# Run metrics visualization for the three supervised learning models chosen
vs.evaluate(results, accuracy, fscore)


# ----
# ## Improving Results
# In this final section, you will choose from the three supervised learning models the *best* model to use on the student data. You will then perform a grid search optimization for the model over the entire training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) by tuning at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F-score. 

# ### Question 3 - Choosing the Best Model
# *Based on the evaluation you performed earlier, in one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML* which of the three models you believe to be most appropriate for the task of identifying individuals that make more than \$50,000.*  
# **Hint:** Your answer should include discussion of the metrics, prediction/training time, and the algorithm's suitability for the data.

# **Answer: 
# Logistic Regression is the best model here because it has best balance on training/testing time, accuracy/f-score on this 3 data distributions. It takes time on training but prediction time is greate with higher accuracy and f-score.
# 
# SVM is also performing well and has similar accuracy/f-score like Logistic regression but takes much time in training.
# 
# Naive Bayes: It performs really bad here as it takes little time while training but prediction time and accuracy/f-score is pretty bad. Not recommanded at all.
# **

# ### Question 4 - Describing the Model in Layman's Terms
# *In one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML*, in layman's terms, how the final model chosen is supposed to work. Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction. Avoid using advanced mathematical or technical jargon, such as describing equations or discussing the algorithm implementation.*

# **Answer: 
# Logistic regression makes predictions using probability:
# 
# 0 = you are absolutely sure that the person is not going to be successful in her life
# 1 = you are absolutely sure that the person is going to be successful 5 years from now on
# Any value above 0.5 = you are pretty sure about that person succeeding. Say you predict 0.8, then you are 80% confident that the person will succeed. Likewise, any value below 0.5 you can say with a corresponding degree of confidence that the person will not succeed.
# 
# How Logistic Regression works:
# 1) It first multiplies features with weights and add them up, then a function is applied to the sum of these. If the function output is that large, then the classifier would positively relate it with a given certain label.
# 
# 2) There is an objective score to measure how the classifier performs. During training, the predictions are compared to true labels to provide feedback, then the weights are updated in order to get a better score in following predictions.
# 
# 3) For prediction, it applies the weights, multiplication, summation, and function to the testing sample to get the final prediction.
# ** 

# ### Implementation: Model Tuning
# Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
# - Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).
# - Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.
#  - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.
# - Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.
#  - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.
#  - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!
# - Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\beta = 0.5$).
# - Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.
# - Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.
# 
# **Note:** Depending on the algorithm chosen and the parameter list, the following implementation may take some time to run!

# In[16]:

print "Final F-score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5))


# ### Question 5 - Final Model Evaluation
# _What is your optimized model's accuracy and F-score on the testing data? Are these scores better or worse than the unoptimized model? How do the results from your optimized model compare to the naive predictor benchmarks you found earlier in **Question 1**?_  
# **Note:** Fill in the table below with your results, and then provide discussion in the **Answer** box.

# ## Feature Importance
# 
# An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \$50,000.
# 
# Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset.

# ### Question 6 - Feature Relevance Observation
# When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data.  
# _Of these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why?_

# **Answer:
# I believe Occupation, capital-gain, capital-loss, education-num and Age to be most important.
# 
# Occupation is rank one as people earn by the work they are doing. capital-gain and capital-loss is numrical data related to earning so it affact people's income. education and Age comes to last as i found their significant little less on income.

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Compute confusion matrix for a model
model = best_clf
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, model.predict(X_test))
cm = cm.astype('float') / cm.sum(axis=1)[:, np.newaxis] # normalize the data

# view with a heatmap
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, cmap='Blues', square=True, fmt='.4f')
plt.ylabel('True label')
plt.xlabel('Predicted label')
plt.title('Confusion matrix for:\n{}'.format(model.__class__.__name__));


# ### Implementation - Extracting Feature Importance
# Choose a `scikit-learn` supervised learning algorithm that has a `feature_importance_` attribute availble for it. This attribute is a function that ranks the importance of each feature when making predictions based on the chosen algorithm.
# 
# In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Import a supervised learning model from sklearn if it is different from the three used earlier.
#  - Train the supervised model on the entire training set.
#  - Extract the feature importances using `'.feature_importances_'`.

# In[24]:

# TODO: Import a supervised learning model that has 'feature_importances_'
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

# TODO: Train the supervised model on the training set 
model = GradientBoostingClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# TODO: Extract the feature importances
importances = model.feature_importances_

# Top-10 feature importances
print np.sort(importances)[-10:]

# Plot
vs.feature_plot(importances, X_train, y_train)


# ### Question 7 - Extracting Feature Importance
# 
# Observe the visualization created above which displays the five most relevant features for predicting if an individual makes at most or above \$50,000.  
# _How do these five features compare to the five features you discussed in **Question 6**? If you were close to the same answer, how does this visualization confirm your thoughts? If you were not close, why do you think these features are more relevant?_

# **Answer:
# I predicted correctly 4 features that may be more important but the feature i rank 1st is not in top-5 list. :)
# Marital_status is included here that seem to have little effect on income.
# 
# As expected capital-gain and capital-loss is on top of feature selection list. and age, education also matters for income prediction.
# **

# ### Feature Selection
# How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. 

# In[15]:

# Import functionality for cloning a model
from sklearn.base import clone

# Reduce the feature space
X_train_reduced = X_train[X_train.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]
X_test_reduced = X_test[X_test.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]

# Train on the "best" model found from grid search earlier
clf = (clone(best_clf)).fit(X_train_reduced, y_train)

# Make new predictions
reduced_predictions = clf.predict(X_test_reduced)

# Report scores from the final model using both versions of data
print "Final Model trained on full data\n------"
print "Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, best_predictions))
print "F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5))
print "\nFinal Model trained on reduced data\n------"
print "Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, reduced_predictions))
print "F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, reduced_predictions, beta = 0.5))


# ### Question 8 - Effects of Feature Selection
# *How does the final model's F-score and accuracy score on the reduced data using only five features compare to those same scores when all features are used?*  
# *If training time was a factor, would you consider using the reduced data as your training set?*

# **Answer:
# One can prefer reduced data as it covers important features and accuracy is just little lower but not affated much if running time matters.
# Yes, I will recommand using reduced data if training time is a factor.
